# Design System: Kingshot, Demystified — dey.ci

## Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Night-Scout's Ledger"**

The site is a scout's field ledger read by lamplight on a dark night — the ground is a near-black navy (`#0B0E16`), the prose is warm parchment ivory, and every event gets exactly one glowing signal hue that lights the way: gold for the home court, moss for the hunt, amber for the forge, crimson for the duel, amethyst for the court, gold for the campaign. You read it like marginalia on a campaign report — rules, proofs, and disclosures set as manuscript notes, not boxes.

It is deliberately **printed, not digitized**: sharp letterpress edges (1–3px radii, never round), ruled data-viz drawn in the world's own grammar (bars, wave rails, bracket ranks, square rule cells), a recurring ❧ fleuron as the brand mark, and drifting ember "dust" motes behind the content. Density is high but the voice stays low — copy reads as a companion explaining the event, with the exact maths tucked behind a disclosure prompt so the page never feels like a chore. **Mobile is the primary target**: the layout, fluid type, and the 46rem measure are all built to be read one-handed during a live event, then scale up gracefully.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Ink-on-night: parchment ivory prose on a near-black navy ground, one signal hue per event.
- Printed, not digitized: sharp 1–3px letterpress edges, never rounded cards.
- Manuscript voice: bold for emphasis, italic only for the marginal-gloss voice; display faces never italic.
- Ruled data-viz: bars, wave rails, and bracket ranks drawn in the manuscript grammar.
- Flat paper: depth by tonal layering and hairlines; shadows only for things that lift off the page.
- The ❧ fleuron: opens active nav, tags, rank titles, and disclosure prompts.

## Colors

One warm signal hue per event, receding ink-on-night neutrals, and a rubrication red for failure. The signal's rarity is the point — it marks what's active, not decoration.

### Primary
- **Antique Gold** (`#F5C851`, dim `#D3A33E`): the one signal on the home page — active nav, key numbers, highlights (`.hl`), rule-cell numerals, disclosure prompts, focus states, the progress fill. Dimmed for secondary signal use.
- **The Per-Event Signals** (each page's `--amber` pair, one hue per world): **Moss-Verdigris** `#AEC878` (Bear Hunt — the hunt signal), **Ember Orange** `#E08A3C` (Vikings — the forge), **Duel Crimson** `#E05555` (Swordland — your side), **Amethyst** `#C5A3EE` (VIP — the court), **Campaign Gold** `#D9B25A` (dim `#A9823B`, KVK — the campaign of kings), with the **Strongest Governor** sections stepping up to a brighter **Crown Gold** `#F0CE7A` (dim `#C69A4E`).

### Secondary
- **Enemy Steel-Blue** (`#4E74CB`, dim `#3C5CA6`): the other side in Swordland; **Battle Red** (`#E05555`) is the enemy kingdom in KVK. Used sparingly to name the opponent.

### Neutral
- **Navy-Black Night** (`#0B0E16`): the ground — page background, `--void`.
- **One Step Up** (`#121726`): `--void-2`, fields and raised surfaces behind content.
- **Kingshot Deep Navy** (`#1A2B47`): `--navy`, the deep accent.
- **Parchment Ivory** (`#F1E3C2`): `--ink`, the prose color.
- **Dim Ivory** (`#C7BC9D`): `--ink-dim`, secondary text.
- **Muted Ivory** (`#9D957F`): `--ink-muted`, tertiary (≥5.4:1 on void).
- **Rubrication Red** (`#8C3030`): `--oxblood`, failure marks and rubrication — never for the primary signal.

### Named Rules
**The One Signal Rule.** Each event wears exactly one signal hue (its `--amber`). Everything active is that hue; everything else recedes to ink on night. The signal's rarity is the point — it lights the way without shouting.

**The Ink-On-Night Rule.** Prose is parchment ivory on navy-black night. Never put gray text on a colored background; never use pure black or pure white.

## Typography

**Display Font:** Cinzel Decorative (with Cinzel, serif fallback) — `--display`
**Mid Display Font:** Cinzel (variable 400–900, with Georgia serif fallback) — `--display-2`
**Body Font:** Alegreya (400/700, true italic; with Georgia serif fallback) — `--body`
**Arabic override:** Amiri body + Aref Ruqaa display (via `html[lang="ar"]`)

**Character:** Roman inscriptional letterforms for display (Cinzel has **no italic**), a warm serif for prose — a manuscript read aloud in a tavern, set in stone and ink. Latin + Cyrillic covered by Alegreya/Cinzel; CJK and Thai fall back to system serif.

### Hierarchy
- **Display** (Cinzel Decorative, 700, `clamp(2.25rem, 1.05rem + 6vw, 4.8rem)` `--step-4`): page h1 heroes, `~0.03em` tracking, calibrated to fit "DEMYSTIFIED" on a 320px phone.
- **Headline** (Cinzel, 600–700, `--step-2`/`--step-3`): h2/h3, numerals, rank titles, bar values.
- **Title** (Cinzel, `--step-1`): rule numerals and key readouts.
- **Body** (Alegreya, 400, `--step-0`/`--step-1`): prose, at ≤46rem measure.
- **Label** (Alegreya 700, `--step--1`, `0.08–0.22em` tracking, uppercase): chips, tags, calc titles, gen headers, disclosure prompts — the marginalia voice.

### Named Rules
**The Manuscript Voice Rule.** Emphasis is **bold**, never italic. Italic is reserved for the marginal-gloss voice (`.note`, `.gen-gloss`, `.egg-note`, `.forge-n`, `.paw-trophy`, `.rev`, `.d-formula`).

**The Display Never Italics Rule.** Cinzel has no italic — never italicise display or headline text.

**The Small-Caps Label Rule.** Labels, tags, and prompts are uppercase with wide letter-spacing; body copy stays lower-case and unhurried.

## Layout

A single centered measure column on a dark field. Everything runs inside a **46rem** (`--maxw`) prose column, so each event reads like a ruled ledger page. The page is **mobile-first**: fluid type (`--step--1`…`--step-4`), a 3rem sticky topbar with a scroll progress fill, and a TOC scrollspy rail that tracks the active section (amber + ❧).

- **Rhythm:** fluid spacing scale `--space-s/m/l/xl` (clamps that grow gently with the viewport). Sections breathe with `--space-xl` vertical padding.
- **Topbar:** 3rem, `--chrome` translucent, brand "KINGSHOT · DEMYSTIFIED" + event switcher (`.ev-switch`) + language picker; a 3px amber progress fill along the bottom.
- **Sections:** each `<section>` carries an `h2::before` marker and alternates accent (`section.front`), so the ledger has visible chapters.
- **Responsive:** ~700px breakpoint trims the brand note and tightens the rail; everything is fluid down to 320px.

### Named Rules
**The Measure Rule.** Prose never exceeds 46rem. If a line would, the layout breaks, not the measure.

## Elevation & Depth

**Flat paper, lift only what floats.** The system is fundamentally flat ink-on-night: depth comes from **tonal layering** (void → void-2 fields → hairline borders), not shadows. Box-shadows and colored glows are reserved exclusively for things that physically lift off the page or carry the active signal.

- **Flat surfaces** — cards, sections, ruled data-viz: no drop shadow, depth by layering and hairlines.
- **Floating layers** (the only things with drop shadows): hero portraits, the language menu, egg-note slips, and the swipe preview.
- **The signal glow** — amber `--signal-glow`/`--signal-halo`: a zero-offset inner glow + outer halo on active signal elements (hero portraits on hover). This is the "dark-glow" the detector flags; it is the system's intent, used only on the signal.

### Named Rules
**The Flat-By-Default Rule.** Surfaces are flat at rest. A shadow or glow appears only as a response to state (hover, elevation, focus) or on a genuine float — never as ambient decoration.

**The Thin-Line + Lift Rule.** Where a float exists, the hairline border (1px signal/dim) and the wide dark shadow come as a pair — a defined edge *and* a soft lift together, never one alone.

## Shapes

Sharp and letterpress-engraved. Radius is a whisper — 1–3px — and never rounds into a card. Inputs are squared ink lines (radius 0).

- **Radius scale:** `none` 0 (inputs, rule cells), `sm` 1px (flags), `md` 2px (hero portraits, tags, chips, tier badges), `lg` 3px (the language menu).
- **Rule cells:** square (radius 0) amber numerals `3.8rem` that stamp each rule.
- **Clipping:** `html`/`body` use overflow clipping for the dust field — the detector's clipping finding notes that positioned popovers must escape this clip deliberately.

### Named Rules
**The Sharp Edge Rule.** Radius stays 1–3px. Never round a card, a button, or a field — the world is printed, not pillowed.

## Components

The system's "buttons" are **margin prompts, not button chrome** — controls read like marginalia that respond on hover, never like SaaS UI.

### Buttons / Disclosure Prompts
- **Style:** no button box. A disclosure is an uppercase letter-spaced prompt in amber, opened by a ❧ fleuron, with a hairline underline that appears on hover (`details summary`).
- **Shape:** radius 0; underline-only, no fill, no border box.
- **Hover / Focus:** color shifts amber → ink; the ❧ prompt is the affordance.

### Cards / Containers
- **Corner Style:** cardless — the `.cards` grid has no box; cards are `h3` + prose with a `.tag` header.
- **Background:** none (transparent on void); depth is the void-2 field behind, not a card.
- **Shadow Strategy:** none at rest (see Elevation).
- **Border:** hairlines only where a rule is being drawn (1px signal line), never a full card outline.
- **Internal Padding:** `--space-l` gaps between cards, fluid.

### Inputs / Fields
- **Style:** transparent background, `1px` bottom ink-muted rule, radius 0 — an ink line, not a field.
- **Focus:** the bottom rule turns amber; no outline, no fill.
- **Range:** amber accent-color, thin, wide.

### Navigation
- **Topbar:** Cinzel Decorative brand + event switcher (body serif, uppercase) + language picker; amber active + progress fill.
- **TOC rail:** scrollspy links, uppercase `--step--1`; active = amber + "❧ " prefix.
- **Language menu:** void-2 surface, `1px` ink-muted border, `3px` radius, `0 10px 28px` float shadow; hover/selected = amber.

### Signature Components
- **Rule cells** — square amber numerals (`3.8rem`) stamping each of the "four rules"; a reversed oxblood cell (`.rev`) marks the failure/rubrication case.
- **The ❧ Fleuron** — the brand mark: opens active TOC links, lead/you tags, rank titles, and disclosure prompts.
- **Ruled data-viz** — sqrt bars (`.bar-fill`), timing wave rails (`.seg`), and reward bracket ranks (`.brackets`) drawn in the manuscript grammar, dim-to-full-signal brightness by rank.
- **Hero portraits** — `4.4rem`, `1px` amber-dim border, `2px` radius, inset signal glow + `0 6px 18px` float; hover lifts with a `0 0 22px` signal halo.
- **The Dust** — drifting ember motes per theme (gold fireflies, ember sparks, crimson motes, candlelight, survey motes) behind the content.
- **The Forge stamp** — a small hammer icon + italic count marking Forgehammer rewards.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- **Do** use the one event signal hue (`--amber`) for everything active and let ink-on-night carry the rest.
- **Do** keep prose at ≤46rem measure and the type fluid down to a 320px phone — mobile is the primary reader.
- **Do** use bold for emphasis and reserve italic for the marginal-gloss voice.
- **Do** draw numbers and ranks as ruled data-viz (bars, rails, brackets) that dim to full signal by rank.
- **Do** use the ❧ fleuron as the mark that opens active nav, tags, rank titles, and disclosures.
- **Do** keep radius at 1–3px and square the rule cells and fields.

### Don't:
- **Don't** use more than one signal hue on a page — the enemy/misc colors (steel-blue, battle red) only name the other side.
- **Don't** put gray text on a colored background, or use pure black/white.
- **Don't** nest cards or wrap content in boxes — depth is tonal layering and hairlines, not card chrome.
- **Don't** add ambient drop shadows or glows to flat surfaces — lift only what floats.
- **Don't** italicise display or headline text (Cinzel has no italic).
- **Don't** break the 46rem measure to fit more on a line.
